This is the note for course MATH 658 Nonlinear Dynamics and Geometric Mechanics by professor [Anthony Bloch](https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~abloch/) at University of Michigan.

The content include differential geometry and its application to control theory and dynamical systems. Geometry in emphasized in understanding the whole process. Also, some examples in mechanical and physics systems are shown.
